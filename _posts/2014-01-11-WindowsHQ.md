# A call from Windows HQ
Recently, I got a phone call, allegedly from the Windows Headquarter in
California. The connection quality was very bad, so I had to ask several
times until I correctly understood where the call came from.

After a few seconds I was sure that this call was a fake. I did not hang
up but wanted to see how they react to my questions.

The phone number of the caller was not visible, so I asked, why they
suppress number transmission. The answer was, that it is an internet
call, that does not have a number to transmit.

The woman told me, that they got several error messages from my Windows
computer. These messages show, that my computer is infected by some
malware that would gradually destroy the software on my computer.

I asked her, which version of Windows I use according to the information
in the error messages. She replied that the version of Windows is not
contained in the messages.

I asked, how she could identify my phone number from the error messages,
while the version of Windows is not reproduceable from the messages. At
this point a man took over the call, saying that he is the supervisor of
the woman I talked to before. He explained to me that after receiving
the error messages they started an internet survey to find out my
contact data.

I asked, how he could prove to me, that he was really calling from
Microsoft. He told me about a CLD, a customer license ID, that only
Microsoft could know. I asked where to find it, and he told me, that I
could find it with his assistance on my computer. With Google in mind I
said I would find it. He statet, that I would need the Windows password
-- not the user password but a special password. Because of this, I would
need his assistance. He asked me which kind of computer I use.

When I told him, he should be able to see whether the infected computer
is up an online, the connection was closed.

The call took about 9 minutes.

I found a [blog] [1] where Fabian Wenk reports a long history of
such calls in Swizerland and Germany (written in german).
